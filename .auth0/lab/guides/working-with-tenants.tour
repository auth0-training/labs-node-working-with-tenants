This guide is designed to walk new users through each of the primary features needed to use Auth0 effectively. Since we're doing that right now through this lab, let's go ahead and hide that guide. \n\n1. #### Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the _Hide this_ link located in the blue box on the right side of the page.  \n    ![select hide this](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/tenants-3.png)    \n    The Activity Dashboard is displayed and a prompt in the upper right-hand corner will let you know how to access the _Getting Started_ page.    \n1. #### The page will reload without the getting started guide.
